# Kleinerfingerlossprache

Kleinerfigerlossprache is a made up German word and it means "pinky-fingerless language". It is meant to represent the lack of necessity for using one's pinky finger as often as they do when writing other computer languages. The motivation behind this was that my pinky finger would get really tired from opening and closing so many parenthesis and brackets. So I made this.
